# Harvest-Choice Code Details
This file provides information on the code used in the following paper: Zhao, J., Daigneault, A., & Weiskittel, A. (2020). Forest landowner harvest decisions in a new era of conservation stewardship and changing markets in Maine, USA. Forest Policy and Economics, 118, 102251.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2020.102251
## Overview
The GitHub repository contains code for the Global Timber Model (GTM) programmed for the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). Specifically, it contains the original model calibration, baseline, and scenario code (.gms files), the parameter sets used to run that code (.csv files), and code to generate model output. The scenarios in this paper were run using GAMS 29.1.0 using a series of ‘save’ and ‘restart’ commands and solved using the MINOS solver. Note that running the code in other versions of GAMS might generate slightly different estimates.
